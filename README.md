#Purpose

The purpose for this file is to create a quick process to analyze the stock market every year. With this, we can get a very good idea of where to invest and where not to by obtaining the return rate. In addition, it is important to have a quick tool that can show results in a very short period of time. 


#Results
##2017
In 2017 we had more than 3 thousand tickers with open and close prices of 12 different market stocks, using the tool we created we can have a quick resume of the behaviour of each one of them:

we can see that almost all of them have a positve return rate, that means the close price is higher than the open price. The stock with the higher increase was DQ with almost 200%, at the same time, this is the stock with the lower Daily volume. 

in the other hand we have TERPR with a negative rate of increase of -7.2% which means that the open price was higher than the close price. 

##2018
During 2018 the stocks behave totally different, now we can see few positive rates (just 2):

which means, prices lower their price a lot in comparisson of how they started, so we have less options than we had during 2017.

#Summary
Overall, 2017 was a better year for investments with more options, also the positve rates where higher than the ones we are seeing in 2018. However, this is just a good approach of the stocks situation over the years, at the end, it will depend on what are or goals and where we want to invest our money. 

There are different ways to makee a code and to make it work, the main difference is how fast and clean is it. We can invest considerable time in coding but the result is worthable if we will have results every time we want and in short time. It is important to have a quick tool with a refactoring code in order to have results and analysis in less than a second, of course it can change depending on the information we have. 
In the other hand, the disadvantage of a refactored code is that you need to have good skills in order to make it clean and fast, also you need to have very clear what you want to do and to use only whatÂ´s necessary. something when we are learning to code, we are not full aware of things that we may be writing but they are not necessary.
